The app will allow users to trade beers with other users. In order for me to be able to build this app, I will need to know how to code in React-Native. I find React-Native a very easy language as the hooks and components make sense to me.

Starting with creating the app framework with a simple command line instruct:

```npm install -g expo-cli```


This line will install the EXPO CLI (command line utility)

```expo init beerMeApp```


```cd beerMeApp npm start```


This will create the app skeleton and run it. To see the app running you will need to have expo installed on your iPhone, and connected to the same wifi network as your computer.

Opening the app.js this will allow you to edit the file in your IDE. I use visual studio code and use the local terminal for my command line prompts.

This will install the framework in your node-modules. The import command in order to add different components into your file is below. Importing the component from { 'reactstrap' }; will ensure that it gets passed to the correct component.



The stack used for this application is:
- MobX
- React-Native
- ReactBase
